### requirements.py files has all the requirements for django
#### note: some libs are installed automatically as my default env-setup but never used in this project.

### you only need to run django-app as:

```
    python3 manage.py runserver

```
## Points to note:
### the edit functionality is for few entries due to time boundations and rest all the functionlity is demonstrated in the project.
